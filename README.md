## Elastic Face Recognition on Cloud

[Code Repository](https://github.com/venkatrbalaji/Elastic_Face_Recognition_on_Cloud) | [Documentation](https://github.com/venkatrbalaji/Elastic_Face_Recognition_on_Cloud/blob/main/README.md) <!-- | [Live Demo](#link-to-live-demo-1) -->

Elastic Face Recognition on Cloud is a project that provides an efficient and scalable solution for facial recognition using cloud infrastructure. With core functionalities including face detection, feature extraction, and recognition, the project aims to enable easy deployment and management of face recognition systems in cloud environments. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks, this project offers a high-level API that allows users to train and deploy custom face recognition models. Its value proposition lies in its ability to handle large-scale face recognition tasks with accuracy and speed, making it an ideal choice for applications requiring secure access control, identity verification, and personalized experiences.

## Pied Piper

[Code Repository](https://github.com/venkatrbalaji/PiedPiper) | [Documentation](https://github.com/venkatrbalaji/PiedPiper/blob/main/README.md) <!-- | [Live Demo](#link-to-live-demo-2)  -->

Decentralized, peer-to-peer, shared and secure Android cloud storage application, providing free storage via internet as a service. Each user provides a fixed amount of personal device storage for the application‚Äôs shared memory.

## Personality Classification

[Code Repository](https://github.com/venkatrbalaji/PersonalityClassification) | [Documentation](https://github.com/venkatrbalaji/PersonalityClassification/blob/main/README.md) <!-- | [Live Demo](#link-to-live-demo-2)  -->

Personality Classification Application focused on Semantic Web Mining using Machine Learning. The motive is to use supervised and unsupervised ML techniques on social networking dataset to predict a user‚Äôs personality based on age, gender, political views and pages liked. The project leverages prior research on the five components used to identify an individual‚Äôs personality called the OCEAN attributes.

## Movie Recommendation System

[Code Repository](https://github.com/venkatrbalaji/sml-movie-recommendation) | [Documentation](https://github.com/venkatrbalaji/sml-movie-recommendation/blob/master/README.md) <!-- | [Live Demo](#link-to-live-demo-2)  -->

The sml-movie-recommendation project is a movie recommendation system that uses machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions to users. It utilizes various algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and collaborative filtering to analyze user preferences and recommend movies based on their past interactions. The project's core functionality involves collecting user data, processing it using machine learning models, and generating a list of movie recommendations tailored to each individual user. The value proposition of this project lies in its ability to enhance the movie-watching experience by suggesting relevant and personalized movie choices, saving users time and effort in finding movies that align with their interests.

## Data Mining - Artificial Pancreas System

[Code Repository](https://github.com/venkatrbalaji/Artificial_Pancreas_System_Analysis) | [Documentation](https://github.com/venkatrbalaji/Artificial_Pancreas_System_Analysis/blob/main/README.md) <!-- | [Live Demo](#link-to-live-demo-2)  -->

The overall objective of the project has been split into four different phases, each one intended towards accomplishing a part of the big picture. The course of the project starts with performance metrics and feature extraction followed by the implementation of classification, clustering, and association rule mining techniques on the given time series data. I was introduced to advanced python programming and machine learning techniques through this course, and the project pro- vided the opportunity to explore and learn how impactful data mining can be in analyzing and extracting useful information from otherwise obscure data.

## Minibase - DataBase and Query Processor Implementation

[Code Repository](https://github.com/venkatrbalaji/Minibase_Implementation) | [Documentation](https://github.com/venkatrbalaji/Minibase_Implementation/blob/main/README.md) <!-- | [Live Demo](#link-to-live-demo-2)  -->

Objective of the final phase is to update Minibase to incorporate various functions learnt in lectures as well as integrate the Skyline operation developed in Phase 2 in one of the new functions. We have implemented Clustered BTree Index, Linear Hash Index (Clustered & Unclustered), Group-by/Aggregation operator (based on sorting as well as hash), Index Nested Loop Joins operator, Hash Join operator (hash value based) and Top-K Join operator (NRA based) in Minibase. We have created a driver program to run the given queries on the sample dataset. The queries have been designed to make use of above mentioned operations. Lastly, for all the operations performed, we get the number of disk accesses in the form of read/write counts. Based on the results obtained, a conclusion can be drawn for the operations.

## Distribute Database Systems

[Code Repository](https://github.com/venkatrbalaji/DistributedDatabaseSystems) | [Documentation](https://github.com/venkatrbalaji/DistributedDatabaseSystems/blob/main/README.md) <!-- | [Live Demo](#link-to-live-demo-2)  -->

This course involved three different individual projects focused on gaining practical experience with various distributed database system components, algorithms and technologies.
